# How to Create a Report Bound to JsonDataSource

This example demonstrates how to use the **JsonDataSource** component to bind reports to JSON-formatted data. Refer to the [JSON Data Source](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/400377) documentation section for more instructions.

> The **JsonDataSource** component uses the open-source *Newtonsoft.Json* library to provide JSON data at runtime. Install the [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json) package if your application does not have a reference to this library.
